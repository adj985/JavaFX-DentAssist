# JavaFX-DentAssist

A java fx program that helps dentists to manage their business. It manages the appointments, patient's data, income and outcome, storing interventions data into the database. 
It also creates a document for every patient in a specified folder, and append interventions data inside.

Program was made with NetBeans 8.2 IDE, JDK 8. Mapping and DB connection is provided by Hibernate, so to run this app, you have to provide a username and password in hibernate.cfg, in order to establish a connection with the database(after creating one, of course).
